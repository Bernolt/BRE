### How to Build a Recommendation Engine that isn't MovieLens

ODSC West • October 31, 2019 @ 2:00pm 

Recommendation engines are pretty simple. Or at least, they are made to seem simple by an uncountable number of  online tutorials. The only problem: it’s hard to find a tutorial that  doesn’t use the ready-made and pre-baked MovieLens dataset. Fine. But,  perhaps you’ve followed one of these tutorials and have struggled to  imagine how to, or otherwise implement your own recommendation engine on your own data. In this workshop, I’ll show you how to use  industry-leading open source tools to build your own engine and how to  structure your own data so that it might be “recommendation-compatible”. Note: this workshop will be heavily tilted towards the applied-side of  things. Hope you’re ready to get your hands dirty.
